        <h1>Why This Project Matters</h1>
        <p>
          Immigration plays a crucial role in shaping the U.S. economy. This project was created to highlight 
          the contributions of immigrants in the workforce and to analyze trends using real-world data.

        <h2>üåç The Role of Immigrants in the U.S. Workforce</h2>
        <p>
          Immigrants have historically been a driving force in the American labor market, filling critical roles 
          in industries ranging from **agriculture and construction to technology and healthcare**. In 2024, they 
          make up **18% of the total workforce**, bringing both skilled expertise and essential labor to key sectors.

      <div className="info-section">
        <h2>üìà Economic Impact of Immigrant Labor</h2>
        <p>
          The economic contributions of immigrants extend beyond just employment rates. Immigrant workers 
          **generate billions in tax revenue**, start businesses at **twice the rate of native-born citizens**, and 
          help fill gaps in labor shortages. Studies show that without immigrant labor, many industries 
          would experience **severe workforce shortages** and rising costs.

      <div className="info-section">
        <h2>üõÇ Immigration Policies in 2024</h2>
        <p>
          Immigration policies directly impact the economy, with recent shifts in **visa regulations, border security, 
          and work permits** affecting businesses and workers alike. While stricter policies may reduce undocumented 
          immigration, they also limit labor supply in crucial industries. This project aims to explore **how these policies 
          influence economic trends**.
